# Twilio Account Upgrade Guide

## Why Upgrade?
Your WeRide AI caller app is fully functional, but currently limited by Twilio's trial account restrictions:
- Can only call verified phone numbers
- Cannot verify numbers in certain regions (like Pakistan +923180977791)
- Has usage limits and Twilio branding

## How to Upgrade

### Step 1: Add Credit to Your Account
1. Go to [Twilio Console](https://console.twilio.com)
2. Navigate to **Billing** → **Billing Overview**
3. Click **Add Money** or **Auto-recharge**
4. Add at least $20 (minimum recommended)

### Step 2: Verify Your Identity (If Required)
- Some regions require identity verification
- Upload required documents (ID, address proof)
- This usually takes 1-2 business days

### Step 3: Test Full Functionality
Once upgraded, you can:
- Call ANY phone number worldwide (including +923180977791)
- Remove "This call is from a Twilio trial account" message
- Scale to unlimited usage

## Cost Estimation
- **Voice calls**: ~$0.013-0.03/minute (varies by country)
- **Your Pakistani number**: ~$0.07/minute
- **Monthly cost for 100 calls**: ~$10-15

## Alternative: Use Different Test Numbers
For immediate testing, try verified US numbers:
- Your own US number if available
- Twilio's test numbers
- Family/friends' verified numbers

## Benefits After Upgrade
✅ Call any international number
✅ Professional call experience (no trial messaging)
✅ Production-ready for real users
✅ Unlimited usage scaling
